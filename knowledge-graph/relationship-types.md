# Relationship Types

The [DropThe knowledge graph](https://dropthe.org) supports multiple relationship types across entity categories.

## Core Types

| published-by | Game → Company |
| developed-by | Game → Company |
| produced-by | Movie → Company |

## Cross-Category Links

One of the strengths of the DropThe graph is cross-category linking. A single person entity can connect to companies (employment), movies (acting), games (voice acting), and franchises (creative direction) -- all visible on their [entity page](https://dropthe.org/people/).

## Bidirectional Access

Every relationship is navigable from both sides. Visit a [company page](https://dropthe.org/companies/) to see its people, or visit a [person page](https://dropthe.org/people/) to see their companies.
