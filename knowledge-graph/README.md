# Knowledge Graph

The [DropThe knowledge graph](https://dropthe.org) maps **3.4 million verified relationships** between 1.94 million entities, creating one of the largest independent entity relationship databases on the web.

## What It Does

Traditional databases store entities in isolation. The DropThe knowledge graph connects them -- showing which executives run which companies, which studios produced which games, which actors appear in which franchises, and how family relationships span across industries.

## Scale

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Verified relationships | 3,400,000+ |
| Connected entities | 2M+ |
| Relationship types | 15+ |
| Cross-vertical links | 216,000+ (automated) |
| Family links | 262,000+ |
| Cast/crew links | 59,859 |
| University connections | 64,467 |

## How It Powers DropThe

Every [entity page on the DropThe network](https://dropthe.org) is generated from knowledge graph queries:

- **Related Entities** sections show connected people, companies, and titles
- **Gossip** sections surface non-obvious connections mined by the [Intelligence Engine](../intelligence/)
- **Compare** pages use graph traversal to find meaningful comparison points between entities
- **On This Day** pages query temporal relationships across the entire graph
