# Knowledge Graph

The [DropThe knowledge graph](https://dropthe.org) maps **2.18 million verified relationships** between entities, creating a web of connections across companies, people, entertainment, and technology.

## What It Does

Traditional databases store entities in isolation. The DropThe knowledge graph connects them -- showing which executives run which companies, which studios produced which games, which actors appear in which franchises.

## Scale

- **2.18 million** verified links
- **1.83 million** connected entities
- **15+** relationship types
- Cross-category connections (a person can link to a company, a game, and a movie)

## Example

Take any [company page on DropThe](https://dropthe.org/companies/) -- you'll see connected executives, subsidiaries, products, and related entities. These connections are generated from the knowledge graph, not manually curated per page.
