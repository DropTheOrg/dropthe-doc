# Streaming Data

[DropThe](https://dropthe.org) tracks **685,000 streaming availability records** across major platforms, updated daily.

## What We Track

For every movie and series in our database, we monitor which streaming platforms carry it, in which regions, and whether it's included with subscription or requires rental/purchase.

## Why It Matters

Streaming availability is fragmented and constantly shifting. Content moves between platforms, gets added and removed, and varies by region. DropThe provides a single source to check where something is streaming right now.

## Access

Streaming data is available on individual [movie](https://dropthe.org/movies/) and [series](https://dropthe.org/series/) entity pages across dropthe.org.
