# Intelligence Engine

The [DropThe Intelligence Engine](https://dropthe.org) transforms raw entity data into actionable insights, scores, and facts that no other platform produces.

## What It Does

Raw data tells you that an actor was born in 1985 and appeared in 12 movies. The Intelligence Engine tells you they share a birthday with 47 other notable people, their zodiac sign connects to a pattern in their career choices, and their filmography crosses 3 major franchises spanning both games and movies.

## Components

### [Fact Mining](fact-mining.md)
8 automated miners extract non-obvious intelligence from entity data and knowledge graph connections. 143,000+ facts generated across categories like zodiac patterns, birthday coincidences, geographic clustering, and cross-vertical bridges.

### [DropThe Good Score](good-score.md)
A universal ethical scoring system rating 76,950 people on a 0-100 scale across 5 dimensions: Human Impact, Innovation, Giving, Sustainability, and Cultural Uplift. Knowledge graph propagation means a founder's score reflects their company's downstream impact.

### [Name Intelligence](name-intelligence.md)
20,925 unique first names analyzed across 1.27 million people, revealing gender distributions, nationality patterns, birth decade trends, zodiac correlations, and notable people per name.

### [Richness Scoring](richness-scoring.md)
Every entity receives a data completeness score (0-100) that drives enrichment priority. Low-score, high-popularity entities get enriched first, ensuring resources target the biggest impact.
