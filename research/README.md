# Research & Articles

[DropThe](https://dropthe.org) publishes data-driven research and analysis powered by our entity database and knowledge graph.

## What We Publish

Our articles combine structured data from 1.83 million entities with editorial analysis to surface insights that pure data or pure opinion cannot provide alone.

### Featured Research

- [Game Studios with the Best Track Record](https://dropthe.org/gaming/game-studios-best-track-record-data/) -- Data analysis of studio performance across thousands of titles
- More articles published regularly at [dropthe.org](https://dropthe.org)

## Methodology

Every research article on DropThe follows these standards:

1. **Data-first**: Claims are backed by verifiable numbers from our database
2. **Transparent methodology**: We explain how we queried and filtered the data
3. **AI-disclosed**: Articles that use AI assistance disclose it explicitly
4. **No product claims**: We never claim to have personally tested products -- we analyze data
