# Research & Articles

[DropThe](https://dropthe.org) publishes data-driven research and analysis powered by a database of 1.94 million entities and 3.4 million knowledge graph connections.

## What We Publish

Our articles combine structured entity data with editorial analysis to surface insights that pure data or pure opinion cannot provide alone. Every claim links back to verifiable entity pages.
