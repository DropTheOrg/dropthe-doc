# Data Sources & Methodology

[DropThe](https://dropthe.org) aggregates data from multiple public and structured sources to build a comprehensive entity database.

## Source Categories

### Public Databases
Open data repositories, government filings, and publicly available datasets form the foundation of entity records.

### Structured APIs
Where available, we consume structured data from official APIs to keep records current and accurate.

### Editorial Research
Our research team verifies and enriches entity data through manual review, particularly for relationship mapping and knowledge graph connections.

## Quality Standards

- **Cross-referencing**: Entity data is validated against at least two independent sources
- **Freshness**: Automated pipelines flag stale records for re-verification
- **Completeness**: Coverage gaps are tracked and prioritized for enrichment
- **Transparency**: All [data-driven articles](https://dropthe.org/research/) on DropThe disclose methodology and sources

## Updates

Entity data is refreshed on a rolling basis. Streaming availability records update daily. Knowledge graph connections are verified and expanded continuously.
